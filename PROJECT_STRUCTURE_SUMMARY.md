# Project Structure Summary

This project is a Hugo-based personal website using a customized version of the `hugo-book` theme. Below is a detailed summary of the relevant file and folder structure, with descriptions to assist AI models and developers in further development and theme customization.

---

## Root Directory

- **hugo.toml**: Main Hugo configuration file. Sets site parameters, theme, and other global options.
- **.gitmodules**: Git submodules configuration (e.g., for themes).
- **.hugo_build.lock**: Hugo build lock file (auto-generated, usually not edited manually).

---

## Content & Structure

- **archetypes/**
  - `default.md`: Default archetype for new content files.
- **content/**
  - *(Contains the site's main content, organized by section. E.g., `projects/`, `cv.md`)*
- **data/**
  - *(Currently empty; for custom data files in YAML, TOML, or JSON.)*
- **i18n/**
  - *(Currently empty; for custom translations if multilingual support is needed.)*
- **layouts/**
  - `projects/section.html`: Custom layout for the projects listing page.
  - *(Place other custom layout overrides here to take precedence over theme layouts.)*
- **static/**
  - `images/projects/`: Suggested location for project cover images.
  - *(For other static assets like custom JS/CSS not processed by Hugo Pipes.)*
- **assets/**
  - `scss/custom.scss`: Can be used for custom SCSS overrides that are not color-scheme related, or if an alternative approach to theme modification is taken.
  - *(For Hugo Pipes and asset processing. Note: Theme colors are now primarily managed within the theme's assets.)*
- **public/**
  - *(Auto-generated by Hugo; contains the built site. Not typically edited directly.)*

## Theme: hugo-book

Located in `themes/hugo-book/`. This is a fork of the original hugo-book theme, intended for further customization.

- **theme.toml**: Theme metadata and configuration.
- **README.md**: Documentation for the theme, including features and configuration options.
- **LICENSE**: Theme license (MIT).
- **go.mod**: Go module file for theme dependencies.
- **archetypes/**
  - `docs.md`, `posts.md`: Archetypes for documentation and blog posts.
- **assets/**
  - `_gruvbox_theme_variables.scss`: **(New)** Contains the SASS variable definitions for the Gruvbox color palette (e.g., `$gruvbox-bg-hard`, `$gruvbox-fg-primary`). This is the primary file to edit for changing base color values.
  - `_defaults.scss`: Imports `_gruvbox_theme_variables.scss` and uses these SASS variables within its `@mixin theme-dark` and `@mixin theme-light` to set the theme's CSS custom properties (e.g., `--body-background`, `--color-link`). This file defines how Gruvbox variables are applied to the theme structure.
  - Other SCSS files for theme styling and interactivity (e.g., `_main.scss`, `book.scss`, `_markdown.scss`).
  - JS files (e.g., `search.js`).
  - Subfolders for plugins and theme-specific assets.
- **static/**
  - Static assets provided by the theme (favicons, fonts, SVGs, mermaid.js, etc.).
- **layouts/**
  - Hugo templates for rendering site pages.
  - `partials/`: Reusable template components, especially in `partials/docs/` (e.g., `header.html`, `footer.html`, `menu.html`, etc.).
  - `_default/`, `taxonomy/`, `posts/`, `shortcodes/`: Templates for different content types and taxonomies.
- **i18n/**
  - Translation files for multiple languages (e.g., `en.yaml`, `fr.yaml`, etc.).
- **exampleSite/**
  - Example configuration and content structure for reference.
  - `content.en/`, `content.he/`, `content.zh/`: Example content in different languages, showing recommended organization (e.g., `docs/`, `posts/`).

## Customization Notes

- **Theme Color Customization (Gruvbox):**
  1.  **Define Base Colors:** Edit `themes/hugo-book/assets/_gruvbox_theme_variables.scss`. This file holds all the core Gruvbox color SASS variables (e.g., `$gruvbox-bg-hard`, `$gruvbox-fg-primary`, `$gruvbox-blue-strong`). Change the hex codes here to modify your base palette.
  2.  **Apply Colors to Theme Structure:** Review `themes/hugo-book/assets/_defaults.scss`. The `@mixin theme-dark` (and `@mixin theme-light` for light mode) use the SASS variables from `_gruvbox_theme_variables.scss` to set CSS custom properties like `--body-background`, `--color-link`, etc. For example, `--body-background: #{$gruvbox-bg-hard};`. You can adjust which Gruvbox variable is assigned to which CSS custom property here if needed.
  3.  **Specific Element Styling:** If certain elements are not picking up the desired colors, you might need to add or modify CSS rules in other theme SCSS files (e.g., `_main.scss`, `_markdown.scss`) or, as a last resort for minor tweaks, in the project root's `assets/scss/custom.scss` file. Ensure these rules also utilize the `$gruvbox-...` SASS variables for consistency.
- **Main Page Layout (Centering Content):**
  - The overall page structure (left menu, main content, right ToC) is defined in `themes/hugo-book/layouts/_default/baseof.html`.
  - The `<main>` HTML element in `baseof.html` uses the class `book-layout-main flex`. The CSS for `book-layout-main` (in `themes/hugo-book/assets/_main.scss`) makes this container full-width (`display: flex; width: 100%;`).
  - The main content panel (`<div class="book-page">`) is a flex child. Its centering and width are controlled by its own CSS rules in `themes/hugo-book/assets/_main.scss` (e.g., `max-width`, `margin-left: auto`, `margin-right: auto`). Adjust these values in `_main.scss` to change the main content panel's width and centering next to the fixed-width left menu.
- To override theme templates (HTML structure), copy files from `themes/hugo-book/layouts/` to your project's root `layouts/` directory and modify as needed (e.g., `layouts/projects/section.html`).
- Custom non-color related SCSS/CSS or JS can be added to `assets/` or `static/` in the root directory. Consider using `assets/scss/custom.scss` for project-specific (non-theme fork) SCSS overrides.
- Use the `i18n/` folder for custom translations if enabling multilingual support.
- The `public/` directory is auto-generated and should not be edited directly.
