## Customization Notes

- **Theme Color Customization (Gruvbox):**
  1.  **Define Base Colors:** Edit `themes/hugo-book/assets/_gruvbox_theme_variables.scss`. This file holds all the core Gruvbox color SASS variables (e.g., `$gruvbox-bg-hard`, `$gruvbox-fg-primary`, `$gruvbox-blue-strong`). Change the hex codes here to modify your base palette.
  2.  **Apply Colors to Theme Structure:** Review `themes/hugo-book/assets/_defaults.scss`. The `@mixin theme-dark` (and `@mixin theme-light` for light mode) use the SASS variables from `_gruvbox_theme_variables.scss` to set CSS custom properties like `--body-background`, `--color-link`, etc. For example, `--body-background: #{$gruvbox-bg-hard};`. You can adjust which Gruvbox variable is assigned to which CSS custom property here if needed.
  3.  **Specific Element Styling:** If certain elements are not picking up the desired colors, you might need to add or modify CSS rules in other theme SCSS files (e.g., `_main.scss`, `_markdown.scss`) or, as a last resort for minor tweaks, in the project root's `assets/scss/custom.scss` file. Ensure these rules also utilize the `$gruvbox-...` SASS variables for consistency.

- **Sidebar Menu Customization (Structure, Styling, Dynamic Content):**
    -   **Preferred Method for Deep Customization:** For substantial changes to menu structure, appearance (font sizes, colors, layout), and behavior, directly modifying the theme's own SCSS files and HTML partials is more effective and robust than relying solely on the project root's `assets/scss/custom.scss`.
    -   **Key Theme Files for Menu Styling & Structure:**
        -   Layout Override: Copy `themes/hugo-book/layouts/partials/docs/menu.html` to your project's `layouts/partials/docs/menu.html` to customize its HTML structure.
        -   Global Variables: `themes/hugo-book/assets/_defaults.scss` contains SASS variables like `$menu-width` (controls sidebar width).
        -   Primary Styling Rules: `themes/hugo-book/assets/_main.scss` contains the main CSS rules for menu components. Key selectors to modify or add to include:
            -   `.book-brand`: Styles the site title/your name at the top of the menu.
            -   `.book-menu-links a` (if using the custom structure implemented): Styles the main navigation links (e.g., "About Me," "CV").
            -   Custom classes for dynamic project listing (if implemented): `.book-menu-projects h2` (for the "PROJECTS" title), `.book-menu-category h3` (for category titles), and `.book-menu-category ul li a` (for individual project links).
    -   **Dynamic Project Listing in Menu:**
        -   To automatically populate a "PROJECTS" section, the custom `layouts/partials/docs/menu.html` can use Hugo templating (e.g., `{{ $projects := where .Site.RegularPages "Section" "projects" }}`).
        -   Projects can then be grouped and displayed based on a front matter parameter (e.g., `category: "FPGA & DIGITAL DESIGN"`) in their respective Markdown files (e.g., under `content/projects/`).
        -   This approach avoids manually defining all project links in `hugo.toml`.
    -   **Styling Considerations for Menu Customizations:**
        -   When adding new interactive elements (like a clickable "PROJECTS" title), ensure corresponding styles are added in `_main.scss` for visual consistency and hover/focus states.
        -   For text elements that should not appear interactive (e.g., category titles), use CSS like `cursor: default;` and `user-select: none;`.
        -   Modifying or removing default browser focus outlines (e.g., `outline: none;` on `:focus, :focus-visible`) should be done with care, considering accessibility. If default outlines are removed, provide clear alternative visual focus indicators.

- **Main Page Layout (Centering Content):**
  - The overall page structure (left menu, main content, right ToC) is defined in `themes/hugo-book/layouts/_default/baseof.html`.
  - The `<main>` HTML element in `baseof.html` uses the class `book-layout-main flex`. The CSS for `book-layout-main` (in `themes/hugo-book/assets/_main.scss`) makes this container full-width (`display: flex; width: 100%;`).
  - The main content panel (`<div class="book-page">`) is a flex child. Its centering and width are controlled by its own CSS rules in `themes/hugo-book/assets/_main.scss` (e.g., `max-width`, `margin-left: auto`, `margin-right: auto`). Adjust these values in `_main.scss` to change the main content panel's width and centering next to the fixed-width left menu.
- To override theme templates (HTML structure), copy files from `themes/hugo-book/layouts/` to your project's root `layouts/` directory and modify as needed (e.g., `layouts/projects/section.html`).
- Custom non-color related SCSS/CSS or JS can be added to `assets/` or `static/` in the root directory. Consider using `assets/scss/custom.scss` for project-specific (non-theme fork) SCSS overrides.
- Use the `i18n/` folder for custom translations if enabling multilingual support.
- The `public/` directory is auto-generated and should not be edited directly.

## Extended Customization Notes: Working with Fonts

This section details the process for adding and applying custom web fonts (e.g., from Google Fonts) to both standalone Hugo layouts (like a custom landing page) and within the `hugo-book` theme structure.

### 1. Applying Fonts to a Standalone HTML Page (e.g., `layouts/index.html`)

For pages that do not inherit from the theme's base templates or use their own `<head>` and `<style>` sections:

1.  **Embed Font Link in HTML `<head>`:**
    *   Add the necessary `<link rel="preconnect" ...>` and `<link href="..." rel="stylesheet">` tags from your font provider (e.g., Google Fonts) directly into the `<head>` of your specific HTML file (e.g., `layouts/index.html`).
    *   Ensure the `href` attribute in the stylesheet link correctly includes all desired font families, weights, and styles (e.g., `family=Font1:wght@400;700&family=Font2:ital,wght@0,300..700;1,300..700&display=swap`).

2.  **Define CSS Rules (Inline or Page-Specific CSS):**
    *   Within a `<style>` block in the `<head>` of the same HTML file, or in a CSS file linked only by this page, define the CSS rules to apply the fonts.
    *   Use `font-family: "Font Name", fallback-font-family;` along with properties like `font-weight`, `font-style`, `letter-spacing`, `line-height`, and `font-variation-settings` (for variable fonts).
    *   Example:
        ```html
        <style>
          h1.landing-title {
            font-family: "Space Grotesk", sans-serif;
            font-weight: 400; /* Or desired weight */
            letter-spacing: 0.03em;
          }
          p.landing-intro {
            font-family: "Work Sans", sans-serif;
          }
          .landing-menu-item {
            font-family: "Doto", sans-serif;
            font-variation-settings: "ROND" 100; /* If Doto is variable with ROND axis */
          }
        </style>
        ```

3.  **Apply to HTML Elements:**
    *   Use the CSS selectors (classes, element tags) defined in your styles on the corresponding HTML elements in the body of the page.

### 2. Applying Fonts Throughout the Hugo Theme (e.g., `hugo-book`)

For consistent font application across pages rendered by the theme:

1.  **Embed Font Link in Theme's Head Partial:**
    *   Locate the theme's main HTML head partial (for `hugo-book`, this is typically `themes/hugo-book/layouts/partials/docs/html-head.html`).
    *   Add the *comprehensive* Google Font `<link>` tags (as in step 1.1 above, including *all* fonts needed for the theme) to this file. This ensures fonts are loaded globally for theme pages.
    *   **Key Learning:** Failure to include a font here, or an incorrect link, will cause the browser to use a fallback font for theme elements, even if CSS rules attempt to specify the custom font.

2.  **Define SASS Variables for Fonts (Recommended):**
    *   In the theme's SASS defaults file (e.g., `themes/hugo-book/assets/_defaults.scss`), define SASS variables for your desired font families. This centralizes definitions and improves maintainability.
    *   Example:
        ```scss
        // In themes/hugo-book/assets/_defaults.scss
        $font-family-sans-serif: -apple-system, /* other fallbacks */ !default; // Base fallback

        $font-family-theme-title: "Space Grotesk", $font-family-sans-serif !default;
        $font-family-theme-body: "Work Sans", $font-family-sans-serif !default;
        $font-family-theme-menu: "Doto", $font-family-sans-serif !default;
        ```

3.  **Apply Fonts using SASS Variables in Theme SCSS:**
    *   In the theme's main SCSS files (e.g., `themes/hugo-book/assets/_main.scss`, `themes/hugo-book/assets/_markdown.scss`), use your defined SASS variables to set the `font-family` for relevant selectors.
    *   Example:
        ```scss
        // In themes/hugo-book/assets/_main.scss
        body {
          font-family: $font-family-theme-body;
        }
        .book-brand { // Theme's main site title (e.g., in sidebar)
          font-family: $font-family-theme-title;
          font-weight: 400; // Specify weight as needed
          line-height: 1.0;
          letter-spacing: 0.03em;
        }
        .book-menu-links a { // Main menu links in sidebar
          font-family: $font-family-theme-menu;
          font-variation-settings: "ROND" 100; // For Doto full roundness
        }
        ```

4.  **Styling for Specific Effects (e.g., Small Caps in Theme Title):**
    *   To apply effects like small caps to parts of a theme element (e.g., the site title):
        *   Override or copy the relevant theme HTML partial (e.g., copy `themes/hugo-book/layouts/partials/docs/brand.html` to `layouts/partials/docs/brand.html` for project-level override, or edit directly in the theme if you are maintaining a fork).
        *   Modify the HTML within the partial to wrap text segments in `<span>` tags. For example, if `{{ .Site.Title }}` is "Guilherme Barcelos", change `<span>{{ .Site.Title }}</span>` to `<span>G<span>uilherme</span><br>B<span>arcelos</span></span>`.
        *   In the theme's SCSS (e.g., `_main.scss`), add a CSS rule to target these nested spans:
            ```scss
            .book-brand span span { // Targets the inner spans for 'uilherme' and 'arcelos'
              font-variant: small-caps;
            }
            ```
        *   Ensure any conflicting `text-transform: uppercase;` on the parent element (e.g., `.book-brand`) is removed or commented out if you want true initial caps followed by small caps.

### 3. Troubleshooting Font Issues:

*   **Browser Cache/Hard Refresh:** Always the first step. Use Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac).
*   **Clean Hugo Build:** Delete `public/` and `resources/` directories from your project root and run `hugo` to force a full rebuild of assets.
*   **Developer Tools:**
    *   **Inspect Element & Computed Styles:** Essential for seeing which `font-family` is *actually* active (it will be underlined or highlighted in the font stack shown in the "Computed" tab). If a fallback font is active, the desired custom font is not loading or being applied correctly for that element.
    *   **Console:** Check for any font loading errors (e.g., 404 Not Found for font files).
    *   **Network Tab:** Confirm that font files are being requested from the correct URL (e.g., `fonts.gstatic.com`) and are returning a 200 OK status.
*   **Direct Font Application Test:** Temporarily replace SASS font variables in your SCSS with the direct font name string (e.g., `font-family: "Space Grotesk", sans-serif;`) to check if the SASS variable itself is the issue or if the font isn't loading/applying for other reasons.
*   **Verify Font Names & Links:** Double-check font names for exact spelling in CSS/SASS and in the Google Fonts `<link>` tag's `family=` parameter.
*   **Font Weights:** Ensure specified `font-weight` values are available for the font and match the desired visual appearance. Variable fonts offer a range, while static fonts have discrete weights. An un-styled `<h1>` might have a default browser weight (e.g. `bold` or `700`), while applying a font without an explicit weight might default it to `400` (`normal`). This was a key factor in matching the landing page and theme title appearance.
*   **CSS Specificity:** If styles aren't applying, a more specific CSS rule elsewhere could be overriding your intended styles.

By following these steps and using browser developer tools diligently, custom fonts can be effectively managed and debugged across different parts of a Hugo project.
